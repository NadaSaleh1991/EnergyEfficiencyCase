# Energy Efficiency â€” Narrated EDA & Modeling

A story-style Jupyter notebook that explores how **building design parameters** affect **energy efficiency**. We clean the data, visualize relationships, train baseline and boosted models for **HeatingLoad (Y1)** and **CoolingLoad (Y2)**, and interpret which features matter most.
